# Interview-ready explanation

# "If a PV with ReclaimPolicy=Retain is released, Kubernetes will not automatically reuse it. The claimRef must be manually cleared to make it Available again."

# “When a PV has ReclaimPolicy=Retain and is Released, Kubernetes will not rebind it. The admin must manually remove claimRef to make it Available again.”

#  NODE SELECTOR ===> Node Selector is a Kubernetes feature used to decide on which node a pod should run.
# It works by matching pod requirements with labels assigned to nodes.
# Only nodes with matching labels are eligible to run the pod.
# If no matching node is found, the pod remains in Pending state.
# It helps control and organize workload placement in a cluster.
