# Interview-ready explanation

# "If a PV with ReclaimPolicy=Retain is released, Kubernetes will not automatically reuse it. The claimRef must be manually cleared to make it Available again."

# “When a PV has ReclaimPolicy=Retain and is Released, Kubernetes will not rebind it. The admin must manually remove claimRef to make it Available again.”
