# Static Provisioning – Why we use Node Selector

In static provisioning, the volume is already created.

The volume exists on a specific node or availability zone.

The pod must run on that same node/AZ to use the volume.

Node Selector forces the pod to run on the correct node.

Without nodeSelector, the pod may go to another node and fail.

So: Node Selector is required to match the pod with the existing volume.


# Dynamic Provisioning – Why Node Selector is NOT needed

In dynamic provisioning, the volume is not created yet.

Kubernetes first decides where the pod will run.

After scheduling the pod, Kubernetes creates the volume automatically.

The volume is created in the same node/AZ as the pod.

Because Kubernetes handles everything, nodeSelector is not required.

So: Kubernetes automatically matches pod and volume.
